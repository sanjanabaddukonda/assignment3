
Hello TA(s),

Thank you for grading my assignment. Some notes I wanted to share regarding my assignment:

1)I utilized my own css alongside bootstrap
2)I experienced issues deplying to heroku:
Node version not specified in package.json
         https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#specifying-a-node-js-version

I've followed the instructions and specified the x after the npm however it still doesn't work. I've also recieved assistance from the TA, and the solution didn't work other.

3) my crud operations work however the data doesn't showcase on the table for some reason. I can see my data on mongoDBCompass however.
4) I've attached screenshots of my webpage in the project plan.

thank you for your efforts,
Sri Sanjana Baddukonda
